<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Gabriel</h1>
<h3 align="center">Researcher in NLP, Knowledge Graphs, AI Governance, and Data-Centric Systems</h3>

I am a **Master’s student in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics at the University of São Paulo (USP/ICMC)**, funded by **FAPESP**, and a **collaborative researcher at the Institute of Advanced Studies (IEA-USP)** in the project *AI Agents Governance*. I hold a **B.Sc. in Information Systems** and have a strong academic and practical background as a **Front-End Software Engineer.**

My research vision connects **Data Science**, **AI**, and **public policy**, aiming to develop technological solutions that strengthen evidence-based decision-making.

Although I have professional experience as a **Front-End Software Engineer**, my current interests and ongoing work are centered on:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Knowledge Graphs and Graph-Based Modeling**
- **Machine Learning and AI**
- **Data Engineering and Database Systems**
- **Science, Technology, and Innovation Studies (STS)**
- **Data-driven public policy research**

## 🔬 Academic and Research Focus

- **NLP and Knowledge Graphs:** Development of pipelines for entity extraction, relation modeling, and semantic enrichment of complex domains.
- **AI Governance:** Research activities at IEA-USP focused on emerging technologies, regulatory frameworks, and the societal impact of intelligent agents.
- **Data-Driven Public Policy:** Application of data science methodologies to support public sector decision-making and strategic planning.
- **Databases and Data Management:** Interest in indexing structures, multidimensional data, and efficient query processing for large-scale systems.

## 💼 Professional Background

Although transitioning toward research and data-centric fields, I previously worked as a **Front-End Software Engineer**, developing applications using:

- **Angular**, **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**
- **Ionic**, component-driven architectures
- **REST APIs**, design systems, and performance optimization

This background strengthens my ability to bridge **software engineering** and **data-intensive research applications**.
